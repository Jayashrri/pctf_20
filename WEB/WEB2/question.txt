An user named "CruSieg" is posting messages in support of Terrorism in a famous social media platform. 
He has setup his Home Photography Studio where he works on posts and images with his own camera and personal 
computer. He always uses screenshots to save his works.
But unlucky for him, we have captured some of his other traffic packets that contains some 
data that might be useful. Can you login as CrueSieg and remove all the posts and images 
before its too late?
